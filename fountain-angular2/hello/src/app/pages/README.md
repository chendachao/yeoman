# About
This folder should contain all the *pages* of the application.

Pages can also be considered as *components* but they are *aggregations* of other components as well as specific HTML/CSS/JS.

The naming conventions are the same as for components with the following exceptions:
- the Angular component selector for a page should start with 'page-' to make the component 'type' apparent
